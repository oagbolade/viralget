<p>What data do we store and why? Viral Get stores the minimum data necessary in order for its users and clients to use the platform and analyze terms on Twitter or Instagram. We gather the following data of the free users that login Viral Get:</p>

The login in Viral Get with Twitter&rsquo;s API is mandatory to be able to create reports. This is because Twitter Inc. obliges to access to public data (tweets that go inside the report) through a Twitter account. By logging in, the user accepts this Privacy Policy.  At Viral Get we use the user&rsquo;s account for that purpose. For upgrade from the free plan, users need to provide us the following data:</p>
